# Fingerprint-BloodGroup-Detection.
Our project introduces a non-invasive blood group detection method using fingerprint images. With image processing, segmentation, and CNN-based deep learning, it ensures fast, accurate classification. The web-based deployment enhances accessibility, making it usable across medical facilities, from advanced hospitals to remote clinics.
